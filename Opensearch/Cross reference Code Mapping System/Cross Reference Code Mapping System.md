Leveraging OpenSearch, we propose a Cross-Reference Code Mapping System to dynamically map medical products across terminologies and regulatory frameworks. For example, it maps Paracetamol (UK) to Acetaminophen (US), including dosage details and regulatory codes. Using nested documents, the system efficiently stores and retrieves all related data. Semantic search enables queries like "pain relief tablets," returning relevant matches across terminologies.

Additionally, by incorporating Cross-Cluster Search, the system seamlessly queries datasets stored across multiple clusters, such as those dedicated to specific regions or regulatory frameworks. This ensures unified data access while maintaining localized storage and compliance with regional regulations. Cross-Cluster Search also ensures scalability, allowing new datasets or regions to be added incrementally without disrupting operations.

Powered by OpenSearch, this system improves data interoperability, enhances medication accuracy, reduces errors, and streamlines research workflows. Its scalable design adapts to the evolving needs of the global healthcare community.
